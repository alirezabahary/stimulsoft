    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## STIMULSOFT REPORTS, STIMULSOFT DASHBOARDS, STIMULSOFT FORMS, STIMULSOFT DESIGNER, STIMULSOFT DEMO, DEVELOPER LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Stimulsoft, ("STIMULSOFT") Developer License Agreement ("DLA") is a legal agreement between you, software developer ("DEVELOPER") and STIMULSOFT for STIMULSOFT REPORTS, STIMULSOFT DASHBOARDS, STIMULSOFT FORMS, STIMULSOFT DESIGNER and STIMULSOFT DEMO identified above and including components, source code (if provided), demos, intermediate files, media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE") contained in this installation file.

STIMULSOFT grants to you, a personal, nonexclusive license to install and use the SOFTWARE for the sole purposes of designing, developing, testing, and deploying application programs which you create. If you are an entity, you must designate one individual within your organization to use the SOFTWARE in the manner provided herein.

The SOFTWARE contains functionality intended to limit the duration of its use and is intended to collect certain usage metrics. The installation of this software will install files necessary to operate the software onto the DEVELOPER’S computer and other system files may be installed or updated. As with all installations, back up of the DEVELOPER’S hard drive is recommended before installing the software.

The SOFTWARE is runtime royalty-free for Redistributables.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms of this DLA. If you do not agree to any part of the terms of this DLA, DO NOT INSTALL, USE, DISTRIBUTE IN ANY MANNER, OR REPLICATE IN ANY MANNER, ANY PART, FILE OR PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE.

All SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.

## RIGHTS
You may install and use 1 (one) copy of the SOFTWARE, including any and all source code if provided, or any prior version legally licensed for the same operating system, on a single computer. You acknowledge and agree that if the SOFTWARE's source code is provided, it remains a confidential trade secret of STIMULSOFT.

You may transfer all of your rights to use the SOFTWARE to another person (within your company), provided that you transfer to that person all of the software and documentation provided in this package (including this license agreement), and transfer or destroy all copies in any form. Remember, once you transfer the SOFTWARE, you no longer have any right to use it, and the person to whom it is transferred may use it only in accordance with the copyright law, international treaty, and this license.

## RESTRICTIONS
You may not rent, lease, lend, copy, modify, sub-license, time-share, electronically transmit or receive the SOFTWARE, except as provided in this license, or as directed by STIMULSOFT. You may alter the source code of the SOFTWARE, excluding file names and copyright inscriptions, for the purpose of your use as authorized by this Agreement, but you may not otherwise translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble or otherwise alter the SOFTWARE or its documentation.

You may not reverse engineer, decompile, create derivative works, modify, translate, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. You agree to take all reasonable, legal and appropriate measures to prohibit the illegal dissemination of the SOFTWARE or any of its constituent parts and redistributables to the fullest extent of all applicable local, US Codes and International Laws and Treaties regarding anti-circumvention, including but not limited to, the Geneva and Berne World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Diplomatic Conferences.

DEVELOPER shall not expose SOFTWARE API to its customers, but only its own API.

DEVELOPER may NOT distribute the SOFTWARE, in any format, to other users for report design, development or application compilation purposes. Specifically, if DEVELOPER creates a component using the SOFTWARE as a constituent component, DEVELOPER may NOT distribute the component created with the SOFTWARE (in any format) to users to be used at design time and or for ANY development purposes. This restriction applies to “design time” within IDE (Microsoft Visual Studio and others).

DEVELOPER MUST NOT CREATE ANY TOOL OR SOFTWARE THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY COMPETES WITH THE SOFTWARE WHICH UTILIZES ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE.

THE TRIAL VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE IS FOR TEST PURPOSES ONLY. THE TRIAL VERSION MAY NOT BE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION.

DEVELOPER MUST NOT TRANSMIT DESIGNER.EXE OR ANY OTHER STANDALONE DESIGNER TO SOMEBODY ELSE FOR REPORT DESIGN OR ANY OTHER PURPOSES.

The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single PRODUCT. The SOFTWARE and its constituent parts and any provided redistributables may not be reverse engineered, decompiled, disassembled or separated for use on more than one computer, nor placed for distribution, sale, or resale as individual creations by DEVELOPER. The provision of source code, if included with the SOFTWARE, does not constitute transfer of any legal rights to such code, and resale or distribution of all or any portion of all source code and intellectual property will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all applicable local, federal and international laws. All STIMULSOFT libraries, source code if provided, redistributables and other files remain STIMULSOFT exclusive property.  You may not distribute any files, except those that STIMULSOFT has expressly designated as Redistributable.

SOFTWARE may include certain files ("Redistributables") intended for distribution by you to the users of programs you create. Redistributables include those files selected for deployment by an install utility provided with the SOFTWARE. In any event, the Redistributables for the SOFTWARE are only those files specifically designated as such by STIMULSOFT. Subject to all of the terms and conditions in this DLA, you may reproduce and distribute exact copies of the Redistributables, provided that such copies are made from the original copy of the SOFTWARE or the copy transferred to a single hard disk. Copies of Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing application programs permitted under this DLA that you have created using the SOFTWARE. Under no circumstances may any copies of Redistributables be distributed separately.

## REDISTRIBUTABLES
The following files are considered redistributables under this DLA:
